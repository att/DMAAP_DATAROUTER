<p>
This package defines an interface that can be used by servlet-based HTTP APIs to
make authorization requests and receive authorization responses from an external
authorization entity such as a XACML Policy Decision Point (PDP).
</p>
<p>
In Data Router Release 1, there is no external authorization system.  The provisioning server
will use an implementation of this interface for local authorization of provisioning requests.
